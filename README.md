# Emotions_Detector

Welcome to the Visual Programming 4th Semester Project Repository! This repository contains all the modules and files related to our project for the Visual Programming course. 
In this project, we aimed to apply the concepts and principles of visual programming to develop a functional and interactive software application. The repository is organized in a way that facilitates collaboration, development, and documentation of the project.

# Key Features:

<b>1. Module Directory:</b><br>The repository includes a directory structure that neatly organizes the different modules of our project. Each module focuses on a specific functionality or component of the application, allowing for efficient development and code management.

<b>2. Source Code:</b><br>The repository hosts the complete source code of our project. It includes the visual programming code, such as blocks or nodes, and the underlying logic that drives the application's behavior. The code is written in a language suitable for the chosen visual programming environment or framework.

<b>3. Documentation:</b><br>We understand the importance of clear and comprehensive documentation. This repository includes documentation files that provide an overview of the project, its architecture, and detailed explanations of each module and its functionality. The documentation also guides developers on how to contribute, set up the development environment, and run the application.

<b>4. Resources:</b><br> To support the development process, we have included relevant resources such as images, icons, fonts, or other assets used in the project. These resources are properly organized within the repository, making it easy to locate and use them when needed.

<b>5. Issue Tracker:</b><br>The repository's issue tracker enables effective collaboration among team members. It allows for the reporting and tracking of bugs, feature requests, and other project-related issues. The issue tracker helps us maintain an organized workflow and ensures that all identified issues are appropriately addressed.

<b>6. Collaborative Development:</b><br>This repository is designed to facilitate collaboration among team members. It supports features such as branch management, pull requests, and code review. These features enable smooth collaboration and allow for the seamless integration of contributions from multiple developers.

We are excited to share our Visual Programming 4th Semester Project Repository with you. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and provide feedback. Together, let's create an impressive and functional software application using the power of visual programming!
